Movie Recommendation Project

Overview
This project involves building a movie recommendation system using the MovieLens dataset. The goal is to predict user ratings for movies based on past user behavior and movie characteristics. The project is implemented in Python and makes use of the pandas library for data manipulation and the surprise library for collaborative filtering.

Goals
    Predict user ratings for movies.
    Evaluate the accuracy of the predictions.
    Generate a submission file for evaluation.

What I Learned
    Data preprocessing and manipulation using pandas.
    Implementing collaborative filtering algorithms with the surprise library.
    Handling large datasets and optimizing performance.
    Creating reproducible data science workflows.

Technologies Used
    Python
    pandas
    surprise
