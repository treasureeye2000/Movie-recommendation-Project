Overview
This project creates a recommendation system that predicts how a user will rate a movie they have not yet viewed, based on their historical preferences. 
Source of Dataset
This dataset includes several million 5-star ratings collected from users of the online MovieLens movie recommendation service. For this prediction task, we'll be using a special version of the MovieLens dataset that has been enriched with additional data and resampled to ensure fair evaluation.
* genome_scores.csv - a score mapping the strength between movies and tag-related properties. 
* genome_tags.csv - user assigned tags for genome-related scores
* imdb_data.csv - Additional movie metadata scraped from IMDB using the links.csv file. 
* links.csv - File providing a mapping between a MovieLens ID and associated IMDB and TMDB IDs.
* sample_submission.csv - Sample of the submission format for the hackathon. 
* tags.csv - User assigned for the movies within the dataset.
* test.csv - The test split of the dataset. Contains user and movie IDs with no rating data. 
* train.csv - The training split of the dataset. Contains user and movie IDs with associated rating data. 


Problem Solving Steps
Data Exploration and Preprocessing
* Load the data files.
* Explore the structure of each file to understand the relationships between them.
* Handle missing values, if any.
* Merge datasets where necessary to create a comprehensive dataset.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Analyze the distribution of ratings.
* Investigate user and movie statistics (e.g., average ratings, number of ratings).
* Visualize the data to uncover patterns and insights.
Feature Engineering
* Create user and movie profiles using statistical features (e.g., mean rating, rating count).
* Utilize additional data (e.g., genres, tags) to enrich the profiles.

Model Selection
* Implement collaborative filtering models (e.g., user-based, item-based).
* Implement content-based filtering using movie metadata.
* Use matrix factorization techniques (e.g., Singular Value Decomposition).
Model Training
* Split the data into training and validation sets.
* Train the selected models using the training data.
* Tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.
Model Evaluation
* Evaluate the models using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).
* Compare the performance of different models.
Prediction
* Generate predictions for the test set.
* Ensure the predictions are in the required submission format.
Submission
* Create the submission file with the predicted ratings.
